The lecture is all about how the browser renders a webpage. Parsing, layout and painting are subsets of rendering. So, first of all HTML and CSS are parsed with their respective parsers and a DOM tree will be rendered which in turn generated a layout and then the painting comes into picture. This is the high level understanding of how a webpage is rendered in the browser. 

Parsing HTML:

-> HTML is forgiving in nature.
-> Parsing isn't straight forward.
-> can be halted.
-> Will do speculative parsing.
-> It's reentrant.

Tokenizer is one of the inbuilt tools in the browser which determines the start and closing tags in the HTML code.

Render tree is actually multiple trees:

-> Render Objects
-> Render Styles
-> Render Layers
-> Line Boxes

DOM node to Render Object:

-> Visual Output
-> Geometric Info
-> Can layout and print
-> Hold styles and computed metrics

Paint setup: 

-> Will take the layout rendered tree
-> Create layers
-> Incremental process
-> Builds up over 12 phases
