//You can change only 2 characters
let i = 3;
while (i) {
  console.log( --i+1 );
}

// Explaination: As said in the question, I changed only two characters from the actual given code. That is in line 4, I am incrementing the the console.log value to +1 to meet the given requirement to print the numbers 3, 2, 1 in each line in the console.
