alert("I'm JavaScript!");
alert('Hello') // this line is not having semicolon. Javascript automatically inserts the semicolon after the end of each valid line of code.
alert(`Wor
 ld`) // This is a multiline string. In ECMA 6 scripts backticks are introduced as template literals. We can also insert variables inside a template literal string.
alert(3 +
1
+ 2); // this is multiple line code and its working. In javascript, it is possible to break the lines at + operator and it still works. It is purely for the readability purpose.
